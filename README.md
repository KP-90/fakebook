# Fakebook - A Facebook/Twitter "clone"

## This is the frontend portion of the app

### Live view - https://fakebook-front.onrender.com

*WARNING: App is hosted for free on Render.com. Thus it will take 30s-60s to actually start up, and may be slow to update. This is due to the nature of the 
free part of the hosting site.



The main goal of this project was to learn how to create a frontend that will work with a completely separate backend.
